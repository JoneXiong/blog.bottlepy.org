Feature freeze, lets fix some bugs :)

What is in:

* http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/changelog.html#release-0-10
* plus the new route (filter) syntax

Notable stuff that has to wait for 0.11:

* New TemplateAdapter API
* SimpeTemplate v2
* Comamnd-line reloader that can handle syntax errors.
* Testing API for bottle apps (needs at least one deprecation cycle).
